# AI4LCA WorkShop 2024
The workshop aims to bring together leading experts to explore the latest advancements in the application of artificial intelligence techniques to enhance and streamline the life cycle assessment process.

# Agenda
**Date**: December 14, 2024 <br>
**Location**: University of British Columbia, Vancouver <br>

## Topics
- The fastest path to decarbonization, and how can we simplify LCA to get there.
- The grand challenges that LCA researchers face in scaling solutions (e.g., how can AI help address “mapping” issues?)
- Definition of ground truth, performance metrics, and “good enough”.
- Coordination on data exchange (interoperability), benchmark datasets, and hosting of competitions to foster innovation.
